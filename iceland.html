    <h2>Nation Overview</h2>
       <p>Iceland was first settled in the 9th and 10th century by Scottish and Irish settlers and thus ruled itself effectively until the tiny island was conquered by Norway and Denmark some 300 years later. The country boasts the world's oldest continuously operating legislative assembly, the althingi. Iceland, although limited in resources due to its size, is home to first-rate literary, longevity, and social cohesion by world standards.</p>
     <h3>Key events in the country's history include:</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>Askja Volcano eruption (<time datetime="1875"></time></li>
        <li>Mass Emigration (<time datetime="1875">1875-</time><time datetime="1900">1990</time></li>
        <li>Complete Independence from Denmark (<time datetime="1944">1944</time></li>
        <li>Entrance into the European Economic Area (<time datetime="1994">1994</time></li>
        <li>Economic Crisis (<time datetime="2008">2008</time>)</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Reykjavik is the capital and largest city of Iceland, located on the southern shore of Faxaflói Bay. Steam from hot springs in the region is said to have inspired Reykjavík's name, which loosely translates to Smokey Bay. Its latitude of 64°09' N makes it the world's northernmost capital city. </p>

         <p>The area of nation is quantified as follows:</p>
             <h4>Area in Square Kilometers</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>total:</strong> 103,000 <abbr title="square kilometers">sq km</abbr></li>
        <li><strong>land:</strong> 100,250 <abbr title="square kilometers">sq km</abbr></li>
        <li><strong>water:</strong> 2,750 <abbr title="square kilometers">sq km</abbr></li>

     <h3>Population Distribution and Land Use</h3>
         <p>Iceland is almost entirely urban with half of the population located in and around the capital of Reykjavik; smaller clusters are primarily found along the coast in the north and west.</p>
        <h4>The land use is divided as follows: </h4>
   <ul>
        <li>Agricultural Land: 18.7%</li>

     <h3>Natural Hazards and Terrain</h3>
          <p>Earthquakes and volcanic activity are the most formidible natural threats</p>
         <p>Iceland, situated on top of a hotspot, experiences severe volcanic activity. Eyjafjallajokull (1,666 m) erupted in 2010, sending ash high into the atmosphere and seriously disrupting European air traffic. Scientists continue to monitor nearby Katla (1,512 m), which has a high probability of eruption in the very near future, potentially disrupting air traffic</p>
          <p>The terrain is mostly plateau interspersed with mountain peaks, icefields. The coast is deeply indented by bays and fiords</p>
